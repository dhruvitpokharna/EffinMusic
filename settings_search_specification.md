# Settings Screen Search Feature Specification

## 1. Search Bar Functionality

- **Placement:** The search bar will be positioned at the top of the settings screen, prominently visible to the user.
- **Input Acceptance:** The search bar will be an editable text field that accepts alphanumeric input, including spaces and special characters.
- **Filtering Logic:**
    - As the user types, the displayed settings list will be filtered in real-time.
    - The filtering will be case-insensitive.
    - Settings titles and descriptions (if applicable) will be searched for matching text.
    - Only settings that contain the search query will remain visible.

## 2. Highlighting Matches

- **Visual Distinction:** Matching text within the filtered settings list will be highlighted to provide clear visual feedback to the user.
- **Highlight Style:**
    - **Color:** A distinct background color (e.g., light yellow or a subtle shade contrasting with the default background) will be applied to the matching text.
    - **Font:** The matching text will be bolded.
    - **Size:** The font size of the highlighted text will remain consistent with the surrounding text to avoid disrupting the layout.

## 3. User Experience Considerations

- **Case-Insensitivity:** The search algorithm will convert both the search query and the settings text to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparison to ensure case-insensitive matching.
- **Real-time Filtering:** Filtering will occur instantaneously as the user types, providing immediate feedback and a responsive user experience. This will likely involve debouncing the input to prevent excessive re-rendering for very fast typing.
- **No Results Message:** If the search query yields no matching settings, a user-friendly message will be displayed in the main content area of the settings screen, such as "No results found for '[search query]'."

## 4. Design Specifications

- **Search Bar:**
    - **Size:** The search bar will span the full width of the screen, with a comfortable height for touch interaction (e.g., 48-56dp on Android, similar on other platforms).
    - **Color:** A subtle background color (e.g., light gray or a slightly darker shade than the screen background) with a clear border or shadow to distinguish it. The text input color will be the primary text color of the application.
    - **Font:** The default application font will be used for input text, with a standard font size (e.g., 16sp).
    - **Iconography:** A magnifying glass icon will be placed on the left side of the search bar, and a clear/reset icon (e.g., 'X' or 'clear') will appear on the right when text is present in the search bar.
    - **Hint Text:** Placeholder text like "Search settings..." will be displayed when the search bar is empty.
- **Highlighted Text:**
    - **Background Color:** `#FFFF00` (bright yellow) or a similar high-contrast color.
    - **Font Weight:** Bold.
    - **Text Color:** Default text color of the application.
- **Layout Integration:**
    - The search bar will be fixed at the top of the screen, potentially within the app bar or as a sticky header, ensuring it's always visible even when scrolling through long settings lists.
    - The settings list will dynamically adjust its layout to accommodate the search bar at the top.

## 5. Testing Requirements

- **Basic Functionality:**
    - Enter a full setting name (e.g., "Notifications").
    - Enter a partial setting name (e.g., "Notif").
    - Enter a search term with mixed case (e.g., "notIFICAtions").
    - Enter a search term that matches multiple settings.
    - Clear the search bar and verify all settings reappear.
- **Edge Cases:**
    - **No Matches:** Enter a term that does not exist in any setting.
    - **Empty Search:** Verify behavior when the search bar is empty.
    - **Special Characters:** Test with terms containing special characters (e.g., "Wi-Fi!", "Privacy & Security").
    - **Long Search Terms:** Enter a very long string to ensure performance and layout stability.
    - **Leading/Trailing Spaces:** Test with search terms that have leading or trailing spaces.
    - **Performance:** Rapid typing to ensure real-time filtering remains smooth without significant lag.
    - **Accessibility:** Verify that screen readers correctly announce highlighted text or filtered results.

## 6. Documentation

### User Guide: How to Use Search

1.  **Locate the Search Bar:** At the top of the settings screen, you will find a search bar labeled "Search settings...".
2.  **Enter Your Query:** Tap on the search bar and begin typing the name or a keyword related to the setting you are looking for.
3.  **View Results:** As you type, the list of settings will automatically filter to show only those that match your input.
4.  **Highlighted Matches:** Any text within the setting names or descriptions that matches your search query will be highlighted for easy identification.
5.  **No Results:** If no settings match your search, a message "No results found for '[your query]'" will be displayed.
6.  **Clear Search:** To clear your search and view all settings again, tap the 'X' icon on the right side of the search bar.

### Technical Documentation

- **Component Structure:**
    - `SettingsScreen.js/kt`: Main component responsible for rendering the settings list and integrating the search bar.
    - `SearchBar.js/kt`: Reusable component for the search input field, handling input changes and clear functionality.
    - `SettingsListItem.js/kt`: Component for individual setting items, responsible for rendering the setting name/description and applying highlighting.
- **State Management:**
    - A `searchTerm` state variable will hold the current input from the search bar.
    - A `filteredSettings` computed property/state will derive the list of visible settings based on `searchTerm`.
- **Highlighting Implementation:**
    - A utility function (e.g., `highlightText(text, query)`) will be used to wrap matching substrings with a `<span>` or similar element that applies the highlighting styles. This function will handle case-insensitivity.
    - Example (pseudo-code):
        ```javascript
        function highlightText(text, query) {
            if (!query) return text;
            const regex = new RegExp(`(${query})`, 'gi');
            return text.replace(regex, '<span class="highlight">$1</span>');
        }
        ```
- **Performance Optimization:**
    - Input debouncing (e.g., 200-300ms) will be implemented on the search bar's `onChange` event to limit the frequency of filtering operations, especially on large settings lists.
- **Styling:**
    - CSS/XML styles for `.search-bar` and `.highlight` classes will be defined in the respective stylesheet files (e.g., `styles.css`, `dimens.xml`, `colors.xml`).
